# Strawman API for Battle Pets Arena

I just began working on Battle Pets Arena this evening and I have developed
a strawman API. It is somewhat ill defined; I will firm it up later.
I have attempted to follow the style of the Pet API 
https://github.com/wunderteam/battle-pets-api

As I firm up the API, I can run it by you again. Does that sound good
to you?

Would you mind taking a look at it, and letting me know your thoughts?
Is there any other functionality you would like to see?
Do you have any questions? Suggestions?
I have very little experience with REST, let alone defining REST APIs,
so I appreciate any feedback you might have. 

## The API

### Endpoints

All endpoints require an API key to access.
This key is passed via the X-Pets-Token HTTP header.

### Create a contest

POST /contest

Example JSON payload:

{
    "pet-id-1": "b7c451b0-c6f0-84ab-cd79-094ff432cab2",
    "pet-id-2": "75840baf-f0c6-a8c4-32d3-983a89b7cd01",
    "contest-type": "battle-of-wits"
}

On success, returns the contest-id as a JSON string.

Error responses TBD.

### Retrieve status

GET /contest/status/:contest-id

On success, returns a JSON object like:

{
    "code": 1
    "message": "The contest has completed."
}

Codes, messages, and error responses TBD.

### Retrieve result

GET /contest/result/:contest-id

On success, returns a JSON object like:

{
    "first-place": "b7c451b0-c6f0-84ab-cd79-094ff432cab2",
    "second-place": "75840baf-f0c6-a8c4-32d3-983a89b7cd01",
    "summary": "In English, the summary describes the most exciting events
               that occured during the contest."
}

The "summary" key is optional, since some contests might be completely boring.


## API v2 ideas

- Combine status and result into one
- In memory only, or database needed?
- pet-id-1 to petId1
- return futures?
